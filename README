A simple extension for Google Chrome which changes your new tab page to display a to do list.

You can get just the crx file in the downloads section.

A few subtle features:
* Drag items by moving the bullet next to them.
* Edit items or change the title of the page by clicking on what you want to change.
* Use tab or shift-tab to navigate between items when editing them.
